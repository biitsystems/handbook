# Our Handbook
At biits, we’re working to change the very nature of the retail industry and in order to do this we need to first build an inclusive company with a value-driven culture. That’s easier said than done and difficult to put into practice but in these pages we will put forth our vision for the modern workplace.

As we start growing our team this year, we are starting to formalise our policies and this repository will contain the policies we will use at biits. It represents many hours of research, lots of thoughtful debates, and some serious introspection. It’s certainly not perfect, but we think it’s an exciting place to start.

Each employee is responsible for reading, understanding, and complying with this handbook. Our goal is to provide you with a work environment that is constructive and supports both personal and professional growth.

All feedback, suggestions, questions or comments are welcome at all times and will help us to improve as we grow. This is a work in progress that we hope will get better please feel free to help us.

As a small company, we anticipate changes will be made to this handbook in the future and reserve the right to amend, revise and/or withdraw the provisions set forth in the handbook.
