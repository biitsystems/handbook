# Sprints

Everything we build should be broken down into steps that can be built in less than a week. To ensure that a sprint can be planned we need to have a [cultivated and prioritised backlog](https://github.com/biitsystems/handbook/blob/master/Development/Backlog.md)

## Key points

1. A weekly planning meeting
2. A weekly review meeting
3. We will set daily/weekly goals and aim to hit them.
4. We will not change focus until the week is up (unless the world is falling in)

## Planning

During [sprint planning](https://github.com/biitsystems/handbook/blob/master/Development/Sprint%20Planning.md) we should select tasks based on a Key feature i.e if we say IOT then it is going to need API, till, mobile and web-portal application. All of these tasks will be added to the same board to provide visibilty to the team as a whole.

## Stories

Story tickets will be added to the board based on the requirement agreed during the planning meeting;
UI, API, Web etc will all have separate tasks under these stories to complete the task. If there is a dependency with another discipline then the task can be managed under the same stories and everyone will have visibility on it's level of completeness.

The team is responsible for completing the story selected for the sprint and it is critical that the team [communicate](https://github.com/biitsystems/handbook/blob/master/Team%20Norms/Communication.md) to ensure this get's done.

Tickets will be labeled with discipline names. If there is more than one key feature then Epics will be created i.e for manage 360, epics will be the orders, inventory, reports... under the inventory we might have different stories for smaller chunks of the other all function. I.e implementing create, edit and view categories.
