# Backlog

The product development process can be messy and unwieldy if it’s not managed carefully. In agile projects, product backlog grooming is the key to making sure that projects stay on track. It is important that the backlog stay at least 2 to 3 sprints ahead of the development team this will alert the product owners of possible challenges and obstacles down the road, keeping the team on track and ahead of schedule.

In this document we will list the tools and techiques we can use at biits to aid in this process.

## Meetings

The product backlog grooming meeting, will take place once a week between all PMs and the product owner/customer advocates during which the participants will break the backlog down into user stories and reprioritise them.

- Writing new user stories.
- Refining and reprioritizing previously written user stories and breaking them down into smaller stories, if needed.
- Redefining acceptance and testing criteria.
- Reviewing time and personnel estimates for individual backlog items, utilizing what we’ve learned from completed sprints.
- Adding new product features, then prioritising and estimating them.
- Looking more extensively into the total backlog to enable long-range technical and project planning.

## Attendees

Should include the project manager, the customer point of contact and key individual development team members, if required. A well organized backlog grooming meeting can save the time of valuable development resources.

## Goal

The goal of the product backlog groooming meeting is to orer the Product Backlog based on priority, value, dependencies, risk and how much we will learn. Often only priority and value are considered. But, for example, although the roof of a house might be the most important in a rainy area, you still first need to build the foundation. Therefore, when ordering a backlog, also take into account the dependencies, risk and amount of learning.

## Tips

### Start with the two "R"s

Our roadmap and requirements provide the foundation for the product backlog. Roadmap initiatives break down into several epics, and each epic will have several requirements and user stories.

Since the Teams in Space website is the first initiative in the roadmap, we'll want to break down that initiative into epics and user stories for each of those epics.

### Focus on

Use the DEEP (detailed, emergent, estimated, prioritized) acronym as a guidance for managing the Product Backlog and INVEST (independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, testable) as a checklist to ensure high quality user stories.

# Team Effort

 Consider managing the Product Backlog as an effort for the entire team. Although the Product Owner is responsible in ordering the backlog, it’s up to the whole team to provide all the necessary input. Writing user stories therefore is also a responsibility for every team member. The Product Owner can define the stories, but it’s up to the team to make them ‘ready’.
