# Feature Teams

At biits our development teams are gathered around customer-centric features and include the full scope of software development roles â€“ developer, architect, tester, product manager etc. Feature teams are self-managing units, their goal enforces them to self-coordination and cooperation within the team to ensure end-to-end completion. They are given the complete requirements, keep all dependencies within the team and can deliver a full customer feature.

## Team makeup

The team should be between 5 and 7 people and consisting of:

* 1 UX/UI designer
* 1 Project Manager
* 1 Tester
* 1 / 2 Frontend development engineers
* 1 / 2 Backend development engineers

## Sprints

Each sprint ends up building new end-to-end functionality. A team must go through all levels of the technology stack, so there is no place for sprints without an explicit product increment.

## Multi Disciplinary Team

Team members hold their primary roles but must be open to learning new functions. As part of a multi disciplinary team you are working closely with members with different skills and you should look for opportunities to spread your knowledge to other members of the team and to be open to new ideas.

This means that you can switch between different functions and your roles are not limited to only one software development competency. For example, a developer can deal either with programming, as well as with analysing, or even testing if needed.

## Communication

As part of a feature team it is your responsibility to talk with your team to ensure that the sprint goal is reached. There are no handovers you are working as one team. Communicate daily to ensure a clear development process and open communication.

Decisions about how to complete a feature should be made locally within a team instead of a decision taken by the CTO, CEO or a steering committee this optimises time, reduces waiting and stops the project being held back by dependencies. Making the whole team much more productive.

## Boundaries

Teams are highly cross-functional and boundaries are fairly loose, so engineers will be moving around a lot between teams to work on specific projects. This enables us to spread knowledge and prevent siloing. There should also be a very tight communications loop between engineering, product, design, and the customer excellence teams, which helps to keep us honest, agile, and focused on delivering the right things
