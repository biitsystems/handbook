# Biits Core Values

Before anything else, values come first. Without clear, shared values, we wander independently and contradict one another. Everything's harder when we all believe different things about what's important toÂ us, our company.

## People before numbers.

We value and respect the people we work with, both within the company and outside, and want them to feel able to express their opinions safely and without fear. We want to create an environment where everyone can pursue and share knowledge whilst feeling respected, comfortable and productive. We value continuous improvement, and seek to empower ourselves and the people around us with the opportunity to take ownership of our mistakes, question our habits and to reflect and improve.

## Treat others the way they'd like to be treated.

Our customers and teammates have different needs from our own, so we must consider their perspectives to communicate effectively. We work best together when we empathize with one another, and we create the best product when we understand the people we are building for.

## We succeed together when we trust each other.

Trust is the currency that powers every interaction in our teams. Only when we trust each other can we share the candid feedback and opinions that let us be creative and successful. We give our coworkers deep visibility into how our decisions are made and easy outlets to help them give input and guide our course. When we build trust through good communication, we create an environment for better communication in the future.
