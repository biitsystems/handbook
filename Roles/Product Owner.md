# Product Owner

The Product Owner is responsible for driving and defining the effective delivery of complex, high-risk products and services. They must have strong communication skills and be comfortable engaging with senior stakeholders. You should have a solid grasp on data analytics, strategy, and Agile methodologies in order to deliver a high-quality product to increase company revenue.

## Expectations

### Day to day
* Developing and adapting the product vision.
* Writing new user stories (☼).
* Splitting user stories which are too big (☼).
* Specifying acceptance criteria for each user story (☼).
* Writing acceptance tests (☼).
* Ordering the product backlog (via ROI, Kano model, cost-value, MoSCoW method, etc.).
* Doing release planning.
* Grooming the product backlog (think [INVEST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_%28mnemonic%29) and [DEEP](http://blog.mountaingoatsoftware.com/make-the-product-backlog-deep)).

### Plan ahead

The product owner is expected to ensure epics are ready for teams to begin work on with no known blockers. We expect the product owner to work with customers and the team to transform the customer's high level business objectives in to a roadmap with at least 3 months runway.

#### Key tasks:

* Observing, learning about and analysing the market.
* Observing, learning about, contacting and analysing customers and end users of the product.
* Keeping in touch with every stakeholder of the product regularly.
* Report to management and stakeholders (e.g. release burndown).
* Sharing insights throughout the company regarding the product (micro-blogging, blogging, internal conferences, etc.).

### Leadership

We expect our product owner to nurture a culture of high performance in their teams. Where customers do not provide adequate pressure to deliver, we expect the product owner to constructively challenge our teams. It is important that we’re doing the right thing for our customers: delivering valuable, working software as expediently as we’re able

#### Key tasks:

* Deciding what to build and what not (☼).
  * Giving feedback to the development team
during the sprint to the work accomplished by the development team
  * about their process and interactions.
* Doing Gemba Walks.
* Claiming and explaining a one-click-deploy to keep down transaction costs.
* Claiming and explaining a 10-minute build to preserve fast feedback.
* Claiming and explaining feature flags to preserve flexibility.
* Providing and teaching every available business number to the development team to connect them with the product and its customers to make informed decisions together.

### Participating

We expect our product owner to ensure teams are delivering with acceptable levels of quality. Therefore it is important that you provide different points of feedback and participate in all scrum meetings:

* Providing sprint goal and new user stories for sprint planning.
* Giving feedback regarding the achievement of the sprint goal in the sprint review.
* Reflecting and taking action as a team member in the sprint retrospective.
* Informing, helping and learning in the daily scrum.
* Helping the team to continuously improve this process.

### Learning

It is very important that our product owner be aware of the need to continually learn about everything Agile (e.g. visit user groups, attend conferences, read books, write blogs, etc.). Not just to set an example to the team but to learn new tips and ideas to our processes

#### Some suggestions:

* Exchanging constantly with other product owners in the organisation (e.g. through community of practice).
* Playing with the product.
* Learning and refining your product’s whole value stream, like procurement upstream and marketing and sales downstream.
* Measuring progress (e.g. value delivered to clients in each sprint).
